git status -> Tells us about the untracked files

git add . -> tells git to (make file tracked)add all files

instead of . we can also use file name we want to add

git commit -m "Message" -> it is used to commit files to repo with a message


After adding contents not on empty file 
If we add(git add name.txt) a file we don't want we can use
git restore --staged filename

Also to have a track of all commits done
we use 
git log


If we commit a file by mistake we can check using "git log"
Now to move back to previous commit we use
git reset hashcode of commit
ex-> git reset 9ef47a7e2776afec4d19f14e2993792b4c76c03a

After this we can use "git stash" to make it as it was before
stash is like some directory in backend where it store this stuff
We can use "git stash pop" to change files to what we stashed
After this use "git stash clear" to empty stash

Commits are build on top of one another we can't remove from middle


Now attach your Github repo with this folder we can use
"git remote add origin https://link"
remote means working with url
add means adding a url
origin means name of url

If we need we can add multiple origin like
git remote add origin1 https:/link
Like origin we can use any name

To create a new branch we can use 
"git branch name"
