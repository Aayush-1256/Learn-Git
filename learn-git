git status -> Tells us about the untracked files

git add . -> tells git to (make file tracked)add all files

instead of . we can also use file name we want to add

git commit -m "Message" -> it is used to commit files to repo with a message


After adding contents not on empty file 
If we add(git add name.txt) a file we don't want we can use
git restore --staged filename
