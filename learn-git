git status -> Tells us about the untracked files

git add . -> tells git to (make file tracked)add all files

instead of . we can also use file name we want to add

git commit -m "Message" -> it is used to commit files to repo with a message


After adding contents not on empty file 
If we add(git add name.txt) a file we don't want we can use
git restore --staged filename

Also to have a track of all commits done
we use 
git log


If we commit a file by mistake we can check using "git log"
Now to move back to previous commit we use
git reset hashcode of commit
ex-> git reset 9ef47a7e2776afec4d19f14e2993792b4c76c03a

After this we can use "git stash" to make it as it was before
stash is like some directory in backend where it store this stuff
We can use "git stash pop" to change files to what we stashed
After this use "git stash clear" to empty stash

Commits are build on top of one another we can't remove from middle


Now attach your Github repo with this folder we can use
"git remote add origin https://link"
remote means working with url
add means adding a url
origin means name of url

If we need we can add multiple origin like
git remote add origin1 https:/link
Like origin we can use any name


To push changes on a branch we use
"git push origin(can be any link name) branch_name"

To create a new branch we can use 
"git branch branch-name"

To change HEAD to different Branch
"git checkout branch-name"

To merge two branches
like for ex you create a new branch Adding-Feature
and u commit on this branch
Now if you want to merge it with master branch we use
we first use "git checkout master"
then "git merge Adding-Feature(Name of branch to merge)"

To create a pull request on any repo
We first need to fork the repo
Create a new branch on which we can work
Do changes and commit them
It will automatically as you to create a pull request for this branch on github site
Remenber with one branch you can have one pull request


Removing a commit from Pull request
To remove a commit we can same as earlier 
"git reset hashcode"
"git stash"
"git add ."
"git commit -m 'message' " 
"git push origin branch-name -f "
Now we have to force the change on pull request'


Now if our pull request is accepted then it means
Our main branch is behind than the one we fork
To make them in sync we use
"git pull upstream(link-name-main-repo) master(our-master-branch)"


Squashing multiple commits to one single commit
Suppose you created multiple files and commited them multiple times on your local
But before updating the remote repo you want to squeeze them in one or two commits
"git rebase -i commitCode "  
-i for interactive
commitCode of that commit above which you want to squeeze them in this commit
In interactive rebase
'pick' will be used to pick commit
's' will be used to squash commit to prev pick commit
Post this use ":x" enter
Here before #Please enter commit message
Enter commit message
Again ":x" enter
Commits merged

Merge Conflicts
When two or more people make changes to same line of code in same file
Creates a Pull request and on accepting the pull request git will some conflicts like you have different code for same line should i be using this or that..
Than you should resolve this manually..
